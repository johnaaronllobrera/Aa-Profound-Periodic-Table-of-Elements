Code Description:
	An interactive periodic table of elements is presented. 
	Each element is represented in a table cell, and clicking on an 
	element displays additional information. The table includes categories 
	such as Alkali Metals, Transition Metals, and more. Styling is applied 
	through an external CSS file, and interactive behavior is controlled 
	via JavaScript.

	 Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and 
	 atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of 1.00794 u, hydrogen 
	 is the lightest element on the periodic table.

	Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance 
	in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.
	Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. 
	The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, 
	symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.

	The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the 
	recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is 
	a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly 
	combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen 
	readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most 
	of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or 
	organic compounds.

	 Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. 
	 It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic 
	 gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its 
	 boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.

	After hydrogen, helium is the second lightest and second most abundant
	element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the 
	total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the 
	heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in 
	the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding 
	energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three 
	elements after helium.

	This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product 
	of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the 
	universe is helium-4, and is believed to have been formed during 
	the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by 
	nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.

	 Lithium is a chemical element 
	 with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white 
	 metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements.

	Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the least 
	dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly 
	reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored 
	in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but 
	contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull 
	silvery gray, then black tarnish.

	Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in 
	nature, and instead, appears only in compounds, which are usually 
	ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due 
	to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is 
	commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, 
	lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium 
	chloride and potassium chloride.

	Beryllium is a chemical element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It 
	is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a 
	product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided 
	with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as 
	it is fused and creates larger elements.

	It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination 
	with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain 
	beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As 
	a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle
	alkaline earth metal.

	Beryllium improves many physical properties when added as an 
	alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium 
	copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides until it 
	reaches very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys 
	are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel 
	surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural 
	rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.
	85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace 
	material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites.

	Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced 
	entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar 
	nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system 
	and in the Earth's crust.

	Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more 
	common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are 
	mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The 
	largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer 
	of boron minerals.

	Elemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in 
	meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found 
	naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with 
	difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other 
	elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a 
	brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard 
	(about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at 
	room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as boron 
	filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high
	-strength materials.

	Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. 
	It is the lightest pnictogen, and at room temperature it is a transparent, 
	odorless diatomic gas. Nitrogen is a common element in the universe, 
	estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and 
	the Solar System.

	Nitrogen is the most abundant element in Earth's atmosphere, making up

	occur primarily as compounds. The element nitrogen was discovered

	Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid,

	nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (Nâ¡N)
	dominates nitrogen chemistry, causing difficulty for both organisms and

	causing release of large amounts of often useful energy when the compounds

	Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is 
	a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly 
	reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with 
	most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the 
	third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and

	Dioxygen is used in cellular respiration and many major classes of

	Fluorine is a chemical element with symbol F and atomic number 9. 
	It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow 
	diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative 
	element, it is extremely reactive: almost all other elements, 
	including some noble gases, form compounds with fluorine.

	Among the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in universal abundance and 
	13th in terrestrial abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source 
	of fluorine, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal 
	ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo 
	meaning "flow" became associated with it. Proposed as an element in 
	1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its 
	compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries 
	from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan 
	isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, 
	a process still employed for modern production. Industrial 
	production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest
	application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II.

	Neon is a chemical element with symbol Ne and atomic number 10. 
	It is in group 18 (noble gases) of the periodic table. Neon is
	a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions,
	with about two-thirds the density of air. It was discovered (along 
	with krypton and xenon) in 1898 as one of the three residual rare 
	inert elements remaining in dry air, after nitrogen, oxygen, argon 
	and carbon dioxide were removed. Neon was the second of these three 
	rare gases to be discovered, and was immediately recognized as a new 
	element from its bright red emission spectrum. 
	Neon is chemically inert and forms no uncharged chemical compounds. 

	During cosmic nucleogenesis of the elements, large amounts of neon are 
	built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars. Although neon 
	is a very common element in the universe and solar system (it is fifth 
	in cosmic abundance after hydrogen, helium, oxygen and carbon), it is

	has a single electron in its outer shell 
	that it readily donates, creating a

	Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble:

	 Phosphorus is a chemical element with symbol P and atomic number 15. 
	 As an element, phosphorus exists in two major forms, white phosphorus and 
	 red phosphorus, but because it is highly reactive, phosphorus is never 
	 found as a free element on Earth. At 0.099%, phosphorus is the most abundant 
	 pnictogen in the Earth's crust. With few exceptions, minerals containing 
	phosphorus are in the maximally oxidised state as inorganic phosphate rocks.

	The first form of elemental phosphorus to be produced (white phosphorus, in 1669) 
	emits a faint glow when exposed to oxygen. 
	The term "phosphorescence", meaning glow after illumination, 
	originally derives from this property of phosphorus, although this word has since been 
	used for a different physical process that produces a glow. The glow of phosphorus itself 
	originates from oxidation of the white (but not red) phosphorus â a process now termed 
	chemiluminescence. Together with nitrogen, arsenic, and antimony, phosphorus is classified 
	as a pnictogen

	 Sulfur or sulphur (see spelling differences) is a 
	 chemical element with symbol S and atomic number 16. 
	 It is an abundant, multivalent nonmetal. Under normal 
	 conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic

	 is a bright yellow crystalline solid at room temperature. 
	 Chemically, sulfur reacts with all elements except for 
	 gold, platinum, iridium, nitrogen, tellurium, iodine 
	 and the noble gases.

	Elemental sulfur occurs naturally as the element 
	(native sulfur), but most commonly occurs in combined 
	forms as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Being abundant 
	in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being 
	mentioned for its uses in ancient India, ancient Greece, 
	China, and Egypt. In the Bible, sulfur is called brimstone. 
	Today, almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a 
	byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants 
	from natural gas and petroleum. The greatest commercial 
	use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid 
	for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers, and other 
	chemical processes. The element sulfur is used in 
	matches, insecticides, and fungicides.

	Vanadium is a chemical element with symbol V and atomic 
	number 23. It is a hard, silvery grey, ductile, and 
	malleable transition metal. The elemental metal is rarely 
	found in nature, but once isolated artificially, the 
	formation of an oxide layer (passivation) stabilizes 
	the free metal somewhat against further oxidation.

	Andres Manuel del Rio discovered compounds of vanadium in 
	1801 in Mexico by analyzing a new lead-bearing mineral he 
	called "brown lead", and presumed its qualities were due 
	to the presence of a new element, which he named erythronium 
	since, upon heating, most of 
	the salts turned red. Four years later, however, he was 
	(erroneously) convinced by other scientists that erythronium 
	was identical to chromium. Chlorides of vanadium were 
	generated in 1830 by Nils Gabriel Sefstrom who thereby 
	proved that a new element was involved, which he named 
	"vanadium" after the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and 
	fertility, VanadÃ­s (Freyja). Both names were attributed 
	to the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds. 
	Del Rio's lead mineral was later renamed vanadinite for 
	its vanadium content. In 1867 Henry Enfield Roscoe 
	obtained the pure element.

	Manganese is a chemical element with symbol Mn and

	with iron. Manganese is a metal with important 
	industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in

	Historically, manganese is named for various 
	black minerals (such as pyrolusite) from the 
	same region of Magnesia in Greece which gave 
	names to similar-sounding magnesium, Mg, and 
	magnetite, an ore of the element iron, Fe. By 
	the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl 
	Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce 
	chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that 
	pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) 
	contained a new element, but they were unable 
	to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first 
	to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 
	1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with 
	carbon.

	Manganese phosphating is used for rust and 
	corrosion prevention on steel. Ionized manganese 
	is used industrially as pigments of various colors, 
	which depend on the oxidation state of the ions..

	Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) 
	and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. 
	It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of 
	Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common 
	element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets 
	like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass 
	stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of 
	energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters 
	the iron into space.

	Like the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium, iron exists 
	in a wide range of oxidation states, negative 2 to positive 6, although positive 2 and 3 
	are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen 
	environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear 
	lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, 
	commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers, 
	iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing 
	fresh surfaces for corrosion.

	Cobalt is a chemical element with symbol Co 
	and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt is 
	found in the Earth's crust only in chemically 
	combined form, save for small deposits found 
	in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free 
	element, produced by reductive smelting, is a 
	hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.

	Cobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have 
	been used since ancient times for jewelry and
	paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint 
	to glass, but the color was later thought by 
	alchemists to be due to the known metal bismuth. 
	Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German 
	for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment 
	producing minerals; they were so named because 
	they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous 
	arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, 
	such ores were found to be reducible to a new 
	metal (the first discovered since ancient times), 
	and this was ultimately named for the kobold.

	Today, some cobalt is produced specifically 
	from various metallic-lustered ores, for 
	example cobaltite (CoAsS), but the main 
	source of the element is as a by-product 
	of copper and nickel mining.

	Nickel is a chemical element with symbol 
	Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery white 
	lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. 
	Nickel belongs to the transition metals and 
	is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to 
	maximize the reactive surface area, shows a 
	significant chemical activity, but larger pieces 
	are slow to react with air under standard conditions 
	because an oxide layer forms on the surface and 
	prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, 
	pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in 
	tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the 
	interiors of larger nickel iron meteorites that were 
	not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.
	Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, 
	a reflection of the origin of those elements as 
	major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis.
	An iron nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's inner core.
	Use of nickel (as a natural meteoric nickel iron 
	alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE.

	Copper is a chemical element with symbol Cu

	It is a soft, malleable and ductile metal 
	with very high thermal and electrical

	of pure copper has a reddish-orange color. 
	It is used as a conductor of heat and electricity,

	various metal alloys, such as sterling silver 
	used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine 
	hardware and coins and constantan used in strain 
	gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.

	Copper is found as a pure metal in nature, and 
	this was the first source of the metal to be 
	used by humans, c. 8000 BC. It was the first 
	metal to be smelted from its ore, c. 5000 BC,

	to create bronze, c. 3,500 BC.

	In the Roman era, copper was principally mined 
	on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal, 
	from aes Ñyprium (metal of Cyprus), later
	corrupted to Ñuprum, from which the words copper 
	(English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and

	Zinc is a chemical element with the symbol Zn 
	and atomic number 30. It is the first element 
	in group 12 of the periodic table. In some 
	respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: 
	both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state 
	(+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. 
	Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust 
	and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore 
	is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The 
	largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United 
	States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, 
	and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).

	Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, 
	was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean,
	Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and
	Georgia, and the second millennium BC in West India, 
	Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel (Judea). Zinc 
	metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th 
	century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end 
	of the 16th century. The mines of Rajasthan have given 
	definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 
	6th century BC.[To date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc 
	comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century 
	AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. 
	Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called 
	"philosopher's wool" or "white snow".

	Gallium is a chemical element with symbol Ga and

	table, and thus has similarities to the other metals 
	of the group, aluminium, indium, and thallium. Gallium 
	does not occur as a free element in nature, but as 
	gallium(III) compounds in trace amounts in zinc ores 
	and in bauxite. Elemental gallium is a soft, silvery 
	blue metal at standard temperature and pressure, a 
	brittle solid at low temperatures, and a liquid at 
	temperatures greater than 29.76 degrees celsius 
	(slightly above room temperature). The melting point of 
	gallium is used as a temperature reference point. The alloy 
	galinstan (68.5% gallium, 21.5% indium, and 10% tin) has an 
	even lower melting point of -19 Degrees Celsius (-2 Degrees Fahrenheit), well below the 
	freezing point of water.

	Since its discovery in 1875, gallium has been used to make 
	alloys with low melting points. It is also used in semiconductors 
	as a dopant in semiconductor substrates.

	Gallium is predominantly used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, 
	the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, is used 
	in microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and 
	infrared circuits.

	Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and

	white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically 
	similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. 
	Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance 
	similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium 
	naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in
	nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be 
	found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) 
	state.

	Because it seldom appears in high concentration, 
	germanium was discovered comparatively late in the 
	history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth
	in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's 
	crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence 
	and some of its properties from its position on his periodic 
	table, and called the element ekasilicon. Nearly two decades 
	later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along 
	with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite.
	Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony 
	in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with
	Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon.

	Bromine is a chemical element with symbol Br and atomic number 35. It is the third-lightest halogen, and is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Lowig (in 1825) and Antoine Jerome Balard (in 1826).

	Elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br-) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.

	A chemical element with symbol Kr and atomic number 36. It is a member of group 18 (noble gases) elements. A colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, krypton occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. With rare exceptions, krypton is chemically inert.

	Krypton, like the other noble gases, is used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has many spectral lines, and krypton plasma is useful in bright, high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers), each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. Krypton fluoride also makes a useful laser. From 1960 to 1983, the official length of a meter was defined by the 605 nm wavelength of the orange spectral line of krypton-86, because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes.

	Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, 85Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive 87Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion years; more than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe.

	German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered rubidium in 1861 by the newly developed technique, flame spectroscopy.

	Rubidium's compounds have various chemical and electronic applications. Rubidium metal is easily vaporized and has a convenient spectral absorption range, making it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms.

	Yttrium is a chemical element with symbol Y and atomic number 39. It is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the 9 and has often been classified as a "rare earth element". Yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements in rare earth minerals, and is never found in nature as a free element. 89Y is the only stable isotope, and the only isotope found in the Earth's crust.

	In 1787, Carl Axel Arrhenius found a new mineral near Ytterby in Sweden and named it ytterbite, after the village. Johan Gadolin discovered yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and Anders Gustaf Ekeberg named the new oxide yttria. Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by Friedrich Wohler.

	The most important uses of yttrium are LEDs and phosphors, particularly the red phosphors in television set cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. Yttrium is also used in the production of electrodes, electrolytes, electronic filters, lasers, superconductors, various medical applications, and tracing various materials to enhance their properties.

	Zirconium is a chemical element with symbol Zr and atomic number 40. The name of zirconium is taken from the name of the mineral zircon, the most important source of zirconium. The word zircon comes from the Persian word 'zargun', meaning "gold-colored". It is a lustrous, grey-white, strong transition metal that resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, titanium. Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier, although small amounts are used as an alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion. Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride, respectively. Five isotopes occur naturally, three of which are stable. Zirconium compounds have no known biological role.

	Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile and malleable metal that is solid at room temperature, though it is hard and brittle at lesser purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition.

	Niobium, formerly columbium, is a chemical element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: Niobe, daughter of Tantalus since it is so similar to tantalum.

	Niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum, and the two are difficult to distinguish. The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.

	Molybdenum is a chemical element with symbol Mo and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek ÎÏÎ»ÏÎ²Î´Î¿Ï molybdos, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores. Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.

	Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element. It readily forms hard, stable carbides in alloys, and for this reason most of world production of the element (about 80%) is used in steel alloys, including high-strength alloys and superalloys.

	Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but when molybdenum-bearing minerals contact oxygen and water, the resulting molybdate ion is quite soluble.

	Technetium is a chemical element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element of which all isotopes are radioactive; none are stable. Only one other such element, promethium, is followed (in the periodic table) by elements with stable isotopes. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts are found in the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.

	Many of technetium's properties were predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before the element was discovered. Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese (Em). In 1937, technetium (specifically the technetium-97 isotope) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced, hence its name.

	Ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland, the Russian Empire (one of Russia's Latin names is Ruthenia). Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst.

	Whereas all other group 8 elements have 2 electrons in the outermost shell, in ruthenium, the outermost shell has only one electron (the final electron is in a lower shell). This anomaly is observed in the neighboring metals, niobium (41), rhodium (45), and palladium (46).

It has only one naturally occurring isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals.

He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.

	More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into less noxious substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry. Palladium is a key component of fuel cells, which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.

	A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form ("native silver"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.

	Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. Silver metal is used in many premodern monetary systems in bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as "0.940 fine". As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures.

	Cadmium is a chemical element with symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than other transition metals. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by Stromeyer and Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate.

	Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic.

	Indium is a chemical element with symbol In and atomic number 49. It is a post-transition metal that makes up 0.21 parts per million of the Earth's crust. Very soft and malleable, Indium has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium, but lower than lithium or tin. Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter discovered it with spectroscopy in 1863, naming it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. It was isolated the next year.

	Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between the two in terms of its properties. It is a minor component in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and in the production of transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.

	Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO2. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is Î²-tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey Î±-tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air.

	The first alloy used on a large scale was bronze, made of tin and copper, from as early as 3000 BC. After 600 BC, pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85â90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony, and lead, was used for flatware from the Bronze Age until the 20th century.

	Antimony is a chemical element with symbol Sb (from Latin: stibium) and atomic number 51. A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb2S3). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, kohl. Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery. In the West, it was first isolated by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540.

	For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the Xikuangshan Mine in Hunan. The industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and reduction with carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron.

	The largest applications for metallic antimony is an alloy with lead and tin and the lead antimony plates in leadâacid batteries. Alloys of lead and tin with antimony have improved properties for solders, bullets and plain bearings.

	Tellurium is a chemical element with symbol Te and atomic number 52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.

	Tellurium was discovered in the Habsburg Empire, in 1782 by Franz-Joseph Muller von Reichenstein in a mineral containing tellurium and gold. Martin Heinrich Klaproth named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for "earth", tellus. Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production.

	Commercially, the primary use of tellurium is copper and steel alloys, where it improves machinability. Applications in CdTe solar panels and semiconductors also consume a considerable portion of tellurium production

	Iodine is a chemical element with symbol I and atomic number 53. The heaviest of the stable halogens, it exists as a lustrous, purple-black metallic solid at a standard conditions that sublimes readily to form a violet gas. The elemental form was discovered by the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811. It was named two years later by Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac from this property.

	Iodine occurs in many oxidation states, including iodide (I-), iodate (IO-3), and the various periodate anions. It is the least abundant of the stable halogens, being the sixty-first most abundant element. It is even less abundant than the so-called rare earths. It is the heaviest essential element. Iodine is found in the thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities.

	The dominant producers of iodine today are Chile and Japan. Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition.

	Xenon is a chemical element with symbol Xe and atomic number 54. It is a colorless, dense, odorless noble gas found in the Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized.

	Xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps, and as a general anesthetic. The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule (Xe2) as the lasing medium, and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps. Xenon is used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as the propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft

	Naturally occurring xenon consists of eight stable isotopes. More than 40 unstable xenon isotopes undergo radioactive decay, and the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the Solar System.

	Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 Degrees Celsius (83.3 Degrees Fahrenheit), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at -116 Degrees Celsius (-177 Degrees Fahrenheit). It is the least electronegative element. It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors.

	The German chemist Robert Bunsen and physicist Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy. The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a "getter" in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells. In 1967, acting on Einstein's proof that the speed of light is the most constant dimension in the universe, the International System of Units used two specific wave counts from an emission spectrum of caesium-133 to co-define the second and the metre. Since then, caesium has been widely used in highly accurate atomic clocks.

Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of electrolysis.

	Barium has few industrial applications. Historically, it was used as a getter for vacuum tubes.

	Hafnium is a chemical element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, though it was not identified until 1923, making it the penultimate stable element to be discovered (rhenium was identified two years later). Hafnium is named after Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.

	Hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes. Some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45 nm and smaller feature lengths. Some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium, titanium, or tungsten.

	Hafnium's large neutron capture cross-section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants, but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors.

	Tantalum is a chemical element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, its name comes from Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum. Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers. Tantalum, always together with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the minerals tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite).

	Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, and highly conductive of heat and electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150 Degrees Celsius tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia.

	Tungsten, also known as wolfram, is a chemical element with symbol W and atomic number 74. The word tungsten comes from the Swedish language tung sten, which directly translates to heavy stone. Its name in Swedish is volfram, however, in order to distinguish it from scheelite, which is alternatively named tungsten in Swedish.

	A hard, rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined, tungsten is found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in chemical compounds. It was identified as a new element in 1781, and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite. The free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements. Its high density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material, making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.

	Rhenium is a chemical element with symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. The free element has the third-highest melting point and highest boiling point of any element at 5873 K. Rhenium resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from -1 to +7.

	Discovered in 1925, rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered. It was named after the river Rhine in Europe.

	Nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines. These alloys contain up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element, with the chemical industry's catalytic uses being next-most important.

	Osmium is a chemical element with symbol Os and atomic number 76. It is a hard, brittle, bluish-white transition metal in the platinum group that is found as a trace element in alloys, mostly in platinum ores. Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element, with a density of 22.59 g/cm3. Its alloys with platinum, iridium, and other platinum-group metals are employed in fountain pen nibs, electrical contacts, and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed.

	Osmium has a blue-gray tint and is the densest stable element, slightly denser than iridium. Calculations of density from the X-ray diffraction data may produce the most reliable data for these elements, giving a value of 22.562Â±0.009 g/cm3 for iridium versus 22.587Â±0.009 g/cm3 for osmium.

	Osmium is a hard but brittle metal that remains lustrous even at high temperatures. It has a very low compressibility.

	Iridium is a chemical element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is generally credited with being the second densest element (after osmium). It is also the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000 Degrees Celsius. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.

	Iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium is one of the rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.

	Platinum is a chemical element with symbol Pt and atomic number 78. It is dense, malleable, ductile, highly unreactive, precious, gray-white transition metal. Its name is derived from the Spanish term platina, translated into "little silver".

	Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust with an average abundance of approximately 5g/kg. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.

	Platinum is one of the least reactive metals. It has remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum.

	Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).

	Gold's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally in the universe. It is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis and from the collision of neutron stars and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed.

	Mercury is a chemical element with symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum. A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature.

	Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide.

	Mercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, fluorescent lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments.

	Thallium is a chemical element with symbol Tl and atomic number 81. This soft gray post-transition metal is not found free in nature. When isolated, it resembles tin, but discolors when exposed to air. Chemists William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861, in residues of sulfuric acid production. Both used the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy, in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line. Thallium, from Greek ,thallos, meaning "a green shoot or twig," was named by Crookes. It was isolated by both Lamy and Crookes in 1862; Lamy by electrolysis and Crookes by precipitation and melting of the resultant powder. Crookes exhibited it as a powder precipitated by Zinc at the International exhibition which opened on 1 May, that year.

	It is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut solid lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; the liquid metal has shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm3 exceeds that of most common materials. Lead has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for the relative abundance of lead: it exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements.

	Lead is a post-transition metal, and is relatively inert unless powdered. Its weakened metallic character is illustrated by its general amphoteric nature: it and its oxides react with both acids and bases. It also displays a marked tendency toward covalent bonding. Its compounds are most commonly found in the +2 oxidation state, rather than +4, unlike the lighter group 14 elements.

	Polonium is a chemical element with symbol Po and atomic number 84. A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium, though it also shows resemblances to its horizontal neighbors thallium, lead, and bismuth due to its metallic character. Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138 days) in uranium ores, as it is the penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is more often produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in radiolysis of chemical bonds and immense radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.

	Polonium was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie, when it was chemically separated out of uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: it was the first element to be so discovered.

	Astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the chemical symbol At and atomic number 85, and is the rarest naturally occurring element on the Earth's crust. It occurs on Earth as the decay product of various heavier elements. All its isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. Elemental astatine has never been viewed because any macroscopic sample would be immediately vaporized by its radioactive heating. It has yet to be determined if this obstacle could be overcome with sufficient cooling.

	The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty. Many of these have been estimated based on its periodic table position as a heavier analog of iodine, and a member of the halogens - the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. It is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).

	Radon is a chemical element with symbol Rn and atomic number 86. It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, occurring naturally as a decay product of radium. Its most stable isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of 3.8 days. Radon is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions. It is also the only elemental gas under normal conditions that has no stable isotopes, and is considered a health hazard due to its radioactivity. Intense radioactivity has also hindered chemical studies of radon and only a few compounds are known.

	Radon is formed as one intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains through which thorium and uranium slowly decay into lead. Thorium and uranium are the two most common radioactive elements on earth; they have been around since the earth was formed. Their naturally occurring isotopes have very long half-lives, on the order of billions of years.

	Thorium and uranium, their decay product radium, and its decay product radon, will therefore continue to occur for tens of millions of years at almost the same concentrations as they do now.

	Francium is a chemical element with symbol Fr and atomic number 87. It used to be known as eka-caesium and actinium K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium. Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.

	Bulk francium has never been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reflective metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.

	Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis.

	Radium is a chemical element with symbol Ra and atomic number 88. It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table, also known as the alkaline earth metals. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily combines with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being radium-226, which has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into radon gas (specifically the isotope radon-222). When radium decays, ionizing radiation is a product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence.

	Radium, in the form of radium chloride, was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898. They extracted the radium compound from uraninite and published the discovery at the French Academy of Sciences five days later. Radium was isolated in its metallic state by Marie Curie and Andre-Louis Debierne through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1911.

	Dubnium does not naturally occur on Earth and must be produced artificially. The Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) team claimed discovery in 1968, and the American University of California team did so in 1970. Both teams proposed a name for the new element and used it without waiting for formal approval; similar controversies over priority of discovery occurred with elements 102 to 109. Attempts to resolve the dispute continued from the late 1980s through the 1990s; criteria for discovery were suggested by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party and claims were evaluated against those criteria. Credit for discovery of element 105 was shared between the two teams; the American team protested, but was ultimately rejected. After several rounds of negotiation, names for the new elements were chosen; the final compromise named element 105 dubnium after Dubna, the site of the JINR

Copernicium is calculated to have several properties that differ between it and its lighter homologues, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted to be more difficult to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.

	Nihonium (symbol Nh) is a chemical element with atomic number 113. It is a synthetic element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and is extremely radioactive; its most stable known isotope, nihonium-286, has a half-life of 20 seconds. It is also known as eka-thallium or simply element 113. Nihonium was first reported to have been created in 2003 by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, and in 2004 by a team of Japanese scientists at RIKEN. In December 2015, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element and assigned the priority of the discovery to RIKEN. In November 2016, the IUPAC published a declaration defining the name to be nihonium. The name comes from the common Japanese name for Japan. On 28 November 2016, the name became official.

	In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to thallium in the boron group.

The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to discover livermorium in 2000. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of Livermore, California where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. Four isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 60 milliseconds.

	In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.

One of its daughter isotopes was created directly in 2011, partially confirming the results of the experiment. The experiment itself was repeated successfully by the same collaboration in 2012 and by a joint German-American team in 2014. In 2015, the Joint Working Party of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, which evaluates claims of discovery of new elements, has recognized the element and assigned the priority to the Russian-American team. In June 2016, the IUPAC published a declaration stating that the discoverers suggested the name tennessine after Tennessee, United States; On 28 November 2016, the IUPAC officially adopted the name "tennessine".

	Lanthanum is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metallic chemical element with symbol La and atomic number 57. It tarnishes rapidly when exposed to air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the eponym of the lanthanide series, a group of 15 similar elements between lanthanum and lutetium in the periodic table, of which lanthanum is the first and the prototype. It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals and is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements. The usual oxidation state is +3. Lanthanum has no biological role and is not very toxic.

	Lanthanum usually occurs together with cerium and the other rare earth elements. Lanthanum was first found by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander in 1839 as an impurity in cerium nitrate - hence the name lanthanum, from the Ancient Greek, lanthanein, meaning "to lie hidden". Although it is classified as a rare earth element, lanthanum is the 28th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, almost three times as abundant as lead. In minerals such as monazite and bastnasite, lanthanum composes about a quarter of the lanthanide content. It is extracted from those minerals by a process of such complexity that pure lanthanum metal was not isolated until 1923.

	Cerium is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metallic chemical element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. Tarnishing rapidly when exposed to air, it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the +3 state characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidise water. It is also traditionally considered to be one of the rare earth elements. Cerium has no biological role, and is not very toxic.

	Despite always being found in combination with the other rare earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnasite, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the 9 by its unique ability to be oxidised to the +4 state. It is the most common of the 9, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66 ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.

	Praseodymium is a chemical element with symbol Pr and atomic number 59. Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal in the lanthanide group. It is valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found in native form, and when artificially prepared, it slowly develops a green oxide coating.

	The element was named for the color of its primary oxide. In 1841, Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander extracted a rare earth oxide residue he called "didymium" from a residue he called "lanthana", in turn separated from cerium salts. In 1885, the Austrian chemist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into two salts of different colors, which he named praseodymium and neodymium.

	Neodymium is a chemical element with symbol Nd and atomic number 60. It is a soft silvery metal that tarnishes in air. Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. It is present in significant quantities in the ore minerals monazite and bastnasite. Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other 9, and it is usually refined for general use. Although neodymium is classed as a rare earth, it is a fairly common element, no rarer than cobalt, nickel, and copper, and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust. Most of the world's commercial neodymium is mined in China.

	Neodymium compounds were first commercially used as glass dyes in 1927, and they remain a popular additive in glasses. The color of neodymium compounds-due to the Nd3+ ion-is often a reddish-purple but it changes with the type of lighting, due to the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands of neodymium with ambient light enriched with the sharp visible emission bands of mercury, trivalent europium or terbium. Some neodymium-doped glasses are also used in lasers that emit infrared with wavelengths between 1047 and 1062 nanometers. These have been used in extremely-high-power applications, such as experiments in inertial confinement fusion.

	Promethium, originally prometheum, is a chemical element with the symbol Pm and atomic number 61. All of its isotopes are radioactive; it is one of only two such elements that are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms, a distinction shared with technetium. Chemically, promethium is a lanthanide, which forms salts when combined with other elements. Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3; however, a few +2 compounds may exist.

	In 1902 Bohuslav Brauner suggested there was an element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium (60) and samarium (62); this was confirmed in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known, found there was no element with atomic number 61. In 1926, an Italian and an American group claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61; both "discoveries" were soon proven to be false. In 1938, during a nuclear experiment conducted at Ohio State University, a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced, and the discovery was not generally recognized.

	Samarium is a chemical element with symbol Sm and atomic number 62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that readily oxidizes in air. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually assumes the oxidation state +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide. The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis. Samarium has no significant biological role and is only slightly toxic.

	Samarium was discovered in 1879 by the French chemist Paul emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thereby became the first person to have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a rare earth element, samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as tin.

	Europium is a chemical element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It was isolated in 1901 and is named after the continent of Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium is one of the least abundant elements in the universe; only about 5x10-8% of all matter in the universe is europium.

	Europium is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of lead. It crystallizes in a body-centered cubic lattice. Some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half-filled electron shell. Europium has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all 9.

	Gadolinium is a chemical element with symbol Gd and atomic number 64. It is a silvery-white, malleable and ductile rare-earth metal. It is found in nature only in combined (salt) form. Gadolinium was first detected spectroscopically in 1880 by de Marignac who separated its oxide and is credited with its discovery. It is named for gadolinite, one of the minerals in which it was found, in turn named for chemist Johan Gadolin. The metal was isolated by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1886.

	Gadolinium metal possesses unusual metallurgic properties, to the extent that as little as 1% gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to high temperature oxidation of iron, chromium, and related alloys. Gadolinium as a metal or salt has exceptionally high absorption of neutrons and therefore is used for shielding in neutron radiography and in nuclear reactors. Like most rare earths, gadolinium forms trivalent ions with fluorescent properties. Gadolinium(III) salts have therefore been used as green phosphors in various applications.

The ninth member of the lanthanide series, terbium is a fairly electropositive metal that reacts with water, evolving hydrogen gas. Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime and euxenite.

	Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium as a separate elemental compound in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide, Y2O3. Yttrium and terbium are named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques.

	Terbium is used to dope calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures.

Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven isotopes, the most abundant of which is 164Dy.

	Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, but was not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.

	Dysprosium is a rare earth element that has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife, and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided. Dysprosium's physical characteristics can be greatly affected by even small amounts of impurities.

	Holmium is a chemical element with symbol Ho and atomic number 67. Part of the lanthanide series, holmium is a rare earth element. Holmium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Theodor Cleve. Its oxide was first isolated from rare earth ores in 1878 and the element was named after the city of Stockholm.

	Elemental holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white metal. It is too reactive to be found uncombined in nature, but when isolated, is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature. However, it reacts with water and corrodes readily, and will also burn in air when heated.

	Holmium is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite, and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using ion exchange techniques. Its compounds in nature, and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry, are trivalently oxidized, containing Ho(III) ions. Trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare earth ions (while yielding their own set of unique emission light lines), and holmium ions are thus used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass colorant applications.</div>

	Erbium is a chemical element in the lanthanide series, with symbol Er and atomic number 68. A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements on Earth. As such, it is a rare earth element which is associated with several other rare elements in the mineral gadolinite from Ytterby in Sweden, where yttrium, ytterbium, and terbium were discovered.

	Erbium's principal uses involve its pink-colored Er3+ ions, which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications. Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media, where Er3+ ions are optically pumped at around 980 or 1480 nm and then radiate light at 1530 nm in stimulated emission. This process results in an unusually mechanically simple laser optical amplifier for signals transmitted by fiber optics. The 1550 nm wavelength is especially important for optical communications because standard single mode optical fibers have minimal loss at this particular wavelength.

It is the last element in the lanthanide series, and is traditionally counted among the rare earths. It is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals, although lanthanum is more often considered as such instead of lutetium.

	Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain, as he had published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium.

	Actinium is a radioactive chemical element with symbol Ac (not to be confused with the abbreviation for an acetyl group) and atomic number 89, which was discovered in 1899. It was the first non-primordial radioactive element to be isolated. Polonium, radium and radon were observed before actinium, but they were not isolated until 1902. Actinium gave the name to the actinide series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table. It is also sometimes considered the first of the 7th-period transition metals, although lawrencium is less commonly given that position.

	A soft, silvery-white radioactive metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most 9 and many actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours.

	Thorium is a chemical element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. A radioactive actinide metal, thorium is one of only two significantly radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as a primordial element (the other being uranium).[a] It was discovered in 1829 by the Norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist Jons Jacob Berzelius, who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder.

	A thorium atom has 90 protons and therefore 90 electrons, of which four are valence electrons. Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black when exposed to air, forming the dioxide. Thorium is weakly radioactive: all its known isotopes are unstable. Thorium-232 (232Th), which has 142 neutrons, is the most stable isotope of thorium and accounts for nearly all natural thorium, with six other natural isotopes occurring only as trace radioisotopes. Thorium has the longest half-life of all the significantly radioactive elements, 14.05 billion years, or about the age of the universe.

	Protactinium or protoactinium (former name) is a chemical element with symbol Pa and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids. It forms various chemical compounds where protactinium is usually present in the oxidation state +5, but can also assume +4 and even +2 or +3 states. The average concentrations of protactinium in the Earth's crust is typically on the order of a few parts per trillion, but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits.

	protactinium was first identified in 1913 by Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Gohring and named brevium because of the short half-life of the specific isotope studied, namely protactinium-234. A more stable isotope (231Pa) of protactinium was discovered in 1917/18 by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner, and they chose the name proto-actinium, but then the IUPAC named it finally protactinium in 1949 and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as discoverers.

	Uranium is a chemical element with symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable (with half-lives of the six naturally known isotopes, uranium-233 to uranium-238, varying between 69 years and 4.5 billion years). The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 (which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99%) and uranium-235 (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements. Its density is about 70% higher than that of lead, and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil, rock and water, and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite.

	In nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739-99.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198-0.7202%), and a very small amount of uranium-234 (0.0050-0.0059%). Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating the age of the Earth.

	Neptunium is a chemical element with symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium is the first transuranic element. Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons. Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air. The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7. It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous.

	Although many false claims of its discovery were made over the years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1940. Since then, most neptunium has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors.

	Plutonium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.

	Plutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14, 1940 by Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Joseph W. Kennedy, Edwin M. McMillan, and Arthur C. Wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. They first synthesized neptunium-238 (half-life 2.1 days) which subsequently beta-decayed to form a new heavier element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 87.7 years). Uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune, and so element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was considered to be a planet as well.</div>

	Americium is a radioactive transuranic chemical element with symbol Am and atomic number 95. This member of the actinide series is located in the periodic table under the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.

	Americium was first produced in 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley, California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, a part of the Manhattan Project. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors - one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100 grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.

	Curium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol Cm and atomic number 96. This element of the actinide series was named after Marie and Pierre Curie â both were known for their research on radioactivity. Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most curium is produced by bombarding uranium or plutonium with neutrons in nuclear reactors - one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 20 grams of curium.

	Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a relatively high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is paramagnetic at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element.

This was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium.

	The major isotope of berkelium, 249Bk, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors, mainly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, and at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. The production of the second-most important isotope 247Bk involves the irradiation of the rare isotope 244Cm with high-energy alpha particles.

	Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside of scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides.

	Einsteinium is a synthetic element with symbol Es and atomic number 99. It is the seventh transuranic element, and an actinide.

	Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside of basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.

	Einsteinium is a synthetic element with symbol Es and atomic number 99. It is the seventh transuranic element, and an actinide.

	Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside of basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.

	Fermium is a synthetic element with symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It is a member of the actinide series. It is the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared. A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.

	It was discovered in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, one of the pioneers of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside of basic scientific research.

	Mendelevium is a synthetic element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic element in the actinide series, it is the first element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element. It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51 days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.27 hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.

	Mendelevium was discovered by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles in 1955, the same method still used to produce it today. It was named after Dmitri Mendeleev, father of the periodic table of the chemical elements. Using available microgram quantities of the isotope einsteinium-253, over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour.

	Lawrencium is a synthetic chemical element with chemical symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103. It is named in honor of Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements.

	A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and is also the final member of the actinide series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are currently known; the most stable is 266Lr with a half-life of 11 hours, but the shorter-lived 260Lr (half-life 2.7 minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.

	Chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as the first of the 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium.</div>

	The alkali metals are all shiny, soft, highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and in the case of lithium, nitrogen). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.

The alkaline earth metals are all silver-colored and soft, and have relatively low densities, melting points, and boiling points. In chemical terms, all of the alkaline earth metals react with the halogens to form the alkaline earth metal halides, all of which are ionic crystalline compounds (except for beryllium chloride, which is covalent). All the alkaline earth metals except beryllium also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and, thus, should be handled with great care. The heavier alkaline earth metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones.

Group of elements that does not exhibit such characteristic properties of metals as hardness, mechanical adaptability, or the ability to conduct electricity. This classification is generally applied to the chemical elements carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, sulfur, selenium, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and the noble-gas elements. These elements have few physical properties in common; most are gases, one (bromine) is liquid, and others are solids.

The noble gases are colourless, odourless, tasteless, nonflammable gases. They traditionally have been labeled Group 0 in the periodic table because for decades after their discovery it was believed that they could not bond to other atoms; that is, that their atoms could not combine with those of other elements to form chemical compounds. Their electronic structures and the finding that some of them do indeed form compounds has led to the more appropriate designation, Group 18.

into this category is due to the fact that most of them are not visible at all.

Along the bottom of the periodic table of elements, separated from the main body of the chart, are two rows, the first of which represents the Lanthanides. Composed of lanthanum and the 14 elements of the lanthanide series, the Lanthanides were once called the "rare earth" metals. In fact, they are not particularly rare: many of them appear in as much abundance as more familiar elements such as mercury. They are, however, difficult to extract, a characteristic that defines them as much as their silvery color; sometimes high levels of reactivity; and sensitivity to contamination. Though some Lanthanides have limited uses, members of this group are found in everything from cigarette lighters to TV screens, and from colored glass to control rods in nuclear reactors.

Actinoids or actinides are 15 consecutive chemical elements in the periodic table from actinium to lawrencium (atomic numbers 89 to 103). As a group, they are significantly large because of their radioactivity. Although several members of the group, including uranium (the most familiar), occur naturally, most are man-made.
