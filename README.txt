The table includes categories such as Alkali Metals, Transition Metals, and more. The styling is applied through an external CSS file, and interactive behavior is controlled via JavaScript.

Features
Interactive Elements: Click on any element to display more information.
Categorization: Elements are categorized into groups like Alkali Metals, Transition Metals, etc.
Responsive Design: The table is styled to be visually appealing and functional.

2. style.css: The CSS file responsible for the styling of the periodic table.
